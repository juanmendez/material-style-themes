# material-style-themes
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this module we make updates to color themes. We are including new styling to toolbar, and also app's menu.
I am starting a new course as I need to include that code into this repository in order to display an activity with recyclerview and drawer navigation.
The sources are coming from https://github.com/juanmendez/android-material-design.
=======
This is a demo app over a Pluralsight course. The demo doesn't start from their source files.
Each branch is each module from the video. There are additional notes as comments through the application.

This application uses
* Android Annotations
* Retro Lambda (if required)
* RxAndroid (if required)
