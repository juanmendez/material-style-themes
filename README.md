# Style Inheritance
Through this module we are going to start pulling redundant styling into a parent style, so that way we can start benefiting on refactoring styles.

Ways to inherit (Pseudocode)
MyParentStyle (Base parent style)
MyChild has parent as MyParentStyle (explicit declaration)
MyParenStyle.MyChild (implicit declration)
