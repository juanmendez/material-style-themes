# material-style-themes
In this module we make updates to color themes. We are including new styling to toolbar, and also app's menu.
I am starting a new course as I need to include that code into this repository in order to display an activity with recyclerview and drawer navigation.
The sources are coming from https://github.com/juanmendez/android-material-design.
